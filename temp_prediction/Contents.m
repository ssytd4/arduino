% Temperature Prediction Function
%   temp_prediction   - This function continuously monitors the temperature using
%                       a temperature sensor connected to an Arduino board. It
%                       calculates the temperature change rate in Â°C/min and predicts
%                       the temperature in 5 minutes based on the current rate of
%                       change. LED lights indicate if the temperature is stable within
%                       the comfort range, increasing rapidly, or decreasing rapidly.

% Description
%
%   temp_prediction continuously monitors the temperature using the specified
%   temperature sensor connected to the Arduino board. It calculates the rate of
%   change of temperature and predicts the temperature in 5 minutes based on the
%   current rate of change. The function controls the states of three LEDs to
%   indicate the temperature status:
%
%   - Green LED: Constant light indicates stable temperature within the comfort range.
%   - Yellow LED: Indicates rapid decrease in temperature.
%   - Red LED: Indicates rapid increase in temperature.

% Example
%
%   arduinoObj = arduino;
%   temp_prediction(arduinoObj, 'A0', 'D11', 'D10', 'D9');
%
%   In this example, temp_prediction is called with the specified Arduino object,
%   sensor pin, and LED pins.
